        <h1 >Facebook</h1>
        <p>As of my last update in January 2022, Facebook (now known as Meta Platforms, Inc.) was one of the largest social media companies in the world. Here's a summary of Facebook's key points up to that time:<br>Revenue: Meta Platforms generated substantial revenue primarily from advertising on its various platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The company's revenue grew steadily over the years, driven by its large user base and advertising capabilities.<br>
            Profitability: Meta Platforms maintained strong profitability, with healthy margins on its advertising business. Despite facing increasing competition and regulatory challenges, the company continued to deliver impressive financial results.<br>
             Investments and Expenses: Meta invested heavily in research and development, as well as acquisitions to expand its product offerings and stay ahead of the competition. The company also incurred significant expenses related to infrastructure, data centers, and employee compensation.</p>
